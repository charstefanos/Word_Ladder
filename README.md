# Word_Ladder
A Java program that investigates five letter words from a given dictionary file. 
The ladder transforms a given word (i.e. flour) to a requested word (i.e. bread) by finding 
words with one letter difference to the given word. 
The programs outputs a path/ladder of the shortest length that transforms the start 
word into the end word, when there is a ladder possible, and the length of the shortest path.
It was written using wordladder and Dijkstra's algorithm
